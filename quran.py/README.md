## Purpose
In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate, the King of all creation. All praise is due to Allah; we praise Him; seek His help and forgiveness; we seek refuge in Allah from the evils of ourselves and the evils of our actions. For whoever Allah guides none can misguide and whoever He misguides none can guide; I bear witness that there is no true God but Allah alone with no partners and I bear witness that Muhammad ﷺ is His slave and Messenger. May Allah's peace and blessings be upon Muhammad ﷺ, his family, his companions and those who follow them until the Day of Judgement.  

It is no surpise that [Qur'An.com](https://quran.com/) is (one of) the most famous online Qur'An/Islamic resource available for the Ummah, including verse and word specific translations, Tafsirs, audios, juz numbers, and places of revelation for each Surah. After noticing [Qur'An.com's tedious (and well constructed) API](https://quran.api-docs.io/v4/getting-started/introduction), I decided to create a Python package  specifically designed to assist developers in creating Islamic apps. This package will provide a comprehensive set of classes and methods, aiming to optimize their coding process and save valuable time. Quran.py offers the following:
- Translations
- Tafsirs & Tafsir Info
- Audios of Qur'An recitations
- Recitation Styles
- Languages
- [Chapter Info](https://github.com/ibnaleem/quran.py/tree/main/chapters)
- Juz numbers
- [The verses only revealed in Madīnah](https://github.com/ibnaleem/quran.py/blob/main/chapters/chapters.py#L200)
- [The verses only revealed in Mecca](https://github.com/ibnaleem/quran.py/blob/main/chapters/chapters.py#L152)
- Indopak, Uthmani, and Imlaei Quranic Script
- *more*
