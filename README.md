## Purpose
In the name of Allah, the Most Merciful, the Most Compassionate, the King of all creation. All praise is due to Allah; we praise Him; seek His help and forgiveness; we seek refuge in Allah from the evils of ourselves and the evils of our actions. For whoever Allah guides none can misguide and whoever He misguides none can guide; I bear witness that there is no true God but Allah alone with no partners and I bear witness that Muhammad ﷺ is His slave and Messenger. May Allah's peace and blessings be upon Muhammad ﷺ, his family, his companions and those who follow them until the Day of Judgement.  

After noticing many Islamic Discord servers, I decided to create a Discord bot for the Muslim community to extract almost anything from the Qur'An, such as but not limited to:
- Tafsirs & Verse-specific translations
- Audios of Qur'An recitations
- Juz numbers
- The verses only revealed in Madīnah
- The verses only revealed in Mecca
- Hadith search
- *more*

The purpose of this project is to provide the Muslim Ummah with an easily accessible Qur'An in their Discord server(s) for whatever (good) reasons. [My](https://github.com/ibnaleem) plan is to combine all Islamic tools (AIs, websites, audios, media, etc.) into one multi-purpose Discord bot.
